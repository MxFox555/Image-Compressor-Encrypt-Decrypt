- A compress feature
  - Physically compresses the image
- And a key across the border
  - The key used to decrypt the image

### Decrypt

The decryption side is on the right and consists of:

- A text file location button
  - Used to located a text file with the image data
- A read text file button
  - To read the located text file
- A read text button
